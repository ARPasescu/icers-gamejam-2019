# ICERS - Arctic Reconnaissance Submersibles

## Project description

A simple 2D sidescroller game I developed in Godot 3 back in 2019. The game represented my submission for the intake gamejams of two Dutch game development university programmes.

## Gameplay description

In this game, the player is assigned to lead an exploration operation in the cold waters of the Arcric Ocean. They control a deep-dive submersible called the ICER-S10. There are many relics, artifacts and samples to collect and analyze, all of which are burried in the depths or frozen inside the icebergs.

The gameplay revolves around navigating the submersible through the water ducts below the ice formations in order to find all the artifacts in a level before the timer runs out. The player has to spend some time near each artifact to collect and analyze it. While they are diving and exploring, they must keep track of the available air supplies, and return to the surface to replenish them. They also need to avoid taking damage from hitting the icebergs or the ocean floor. If the submersible is too damaged, the game ends. If the air supply is depleted, the submersible also starts taking damage.

## Other information

All of the art assets (aside from the skybox) were drawn by me. I have also included some scans of the paper drawings I made for some of their designs before recreating them digitally.
